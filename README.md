Selah online grocery

Inspiration
- In the area I live in grocery shopping is done by physically going to a grocery and buying products. This poses a problem to a lot of people who are busy and are unable to do that when they have to. In addition to that, a person might not be able to find the product they are looking for after visiting the grocery. This is another problem that needs a solution. So this is what inspired me to build this application. 

Backend
- python with flask framework

Frontend
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

Database
- SQLite with sqlalchemy ORM

you can find the deployed app at selah.pythonanywhere.com
